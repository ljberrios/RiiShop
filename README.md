# RiiShop
A plugin I made a few months ago for a server called RiiFactions.

You can create as much shops as you want through a command. 
Every shop has its own configuration file and an inventory which you can edit through that file. 

You can add as much items depending on the size you specify for the inventory and each item should have a permission and a price.
If the player has enough funds to buy it, when he/she clicks the item it'll give him/her the permission.
